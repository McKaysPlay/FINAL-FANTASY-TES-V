###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update _Skyrim_ for you and lock you out of playing your _Wabbajack_ modlist(s), open the Properties window of _Skyrim AE_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the _Steam Cloud_. It is incompatible with the profile-specific saves of a _Wabbajack_ modlist.

**Set the Game language to English**

_Wabbajack_ will check your game files and make sure that your installed version is the same as my installed version. This also means that any other language than English will fail the installation. You can change the game's language in the Properties window as mentioned above. It may be required to verify your files afterward.

**Install Skyrim** 

The _Anniversary Edition_ upgrade is required. No exceptions will be made. If you do not have the game installed, do so and launch the vanilla game to download all _Creation Club_ content available with the upgrade. If for some reason you have problems with your _Steam_ installation, you may need to verify the local content as described in _Steam's_ documentation.

If you didn't see / do the step in the image below when you first launch Skyrim AE, then you either don't have the AE DLC or you missed this step.  Verify your Steam files for Skyrim AE which _should_ correct this for you.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory of one of your drives. (D:\ for example.)

**Do Not Use Any Protected Folders inside of OneDrive**

You will experience unusual behavior if your `My Games` folder (usually in the `Documents` folder) is part of a _OneDrive_ Cloud Folder. You will need to relocate it or disable _OneDrive._ There are no exceptions.

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Skyrim Special Edition_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. _Wabbajack_ and _Mod Organizer 2_ both use low-level file system virtualization which most anti-malware programs falsely detect as malicious. 

Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ don't propery respect exclusions and cannot be completely disabled -- they must be fully uninstalled. Please consider avoiding third-party anti-malware solutions and relying on _Windows Defender,_ which is more compatible with the applications used to install and play _Wabbajack_ modlists. 

**Set Pagefile to 40GB Or Above**

This can be accomplished in the System Settings for Windows. It is recommended to set the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` all on one solid state drive as mentioned above. MOre than one pagefile is not needed so long as it is large enough and located on a fast enough drive.

**Ensure Enough Free Storage Space**

FINAL FANTASY TES V requires **223GB** of space for the install and **134GB** of space for the downloads. You can have these located on seperate drives, or on the same drive for a total space requirement of **357GB**. Finally, never reduce the free space on any drive below **15%** (the bar in _File Manager_ will turn red) or you will suffer performance problems.

If you are seeing this, then you are part of the testing group.
Proceeding in using this modlist means you understand and agree to the following:

0. Creating a Wabbajack modlist is a huge time sink and a very painful grind to learn/complete.
1. The modlist is incomplete and transitory (Not all mods have been added, and not all mods will make the final cut!).
2. The mods have been configured for intended play/interactions but are not final - Settings will be adjusted according to feedback.
3. If you feel a part of the game is overtuned/undertuned please use the Simply Balanced mod in the MCM to adjust the game to your playstyle.
4. Do not add mods or remove mods from this list - I will find out & you will be banned from further test groups (you'll have to wait for public betas/releases like everyone else).
5. Take the time to report texture, mesh, blackface bugs - this testing phase is to help develop the modlist into a more stable/playable state - NOT an early access.
6. Don't expect this initial hodge podge of mods to be in any state for a stable and/or long play through.
7. If you have a mod you think would fit well into the theme of the list - let me know.
8. Don't get upset if #7 doesn't make it into the modlist - too many reasons to list why it might not fit in
9. This list is evergreen - this is a living document that will be updated as needed.
10. You must own the Anniversary Addition of Skyrim, and have the Skyrim Creation Kit installed.
