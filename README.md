# FINAL FANTASY TES V
A Skyrim Wabbajack modlist

If you are seeing this, then you are part of the testing group.
Proceeding in using this modlist means you understand and agree to the following:

0. Creating a Wabbajack modlist is a huge time sink and a very painful grind to learn/complete.
1. The modlist is incomplete and transitory (Not all mods have been added, and not all mods will make the final cut!).
2. None of the mods have been configured for intended play/interactions at this point.
3. Seriously, all reports of the modlist being too hard or too easy will be ignored until #2 has had a first pass.
4. Do not add or remove mods from this list - I will find out & you will be banned from further test groups (you'll have to wait for public betas/releases like everyone else).
5. Take the time to report texture, mesh, blackface bugs - this testing phase is to help develop the modlist into a more stable/playable state - NOT an early access.
6. Don't expect this initial hodge podge of mods to be in any state for a stable and/or long play through.
7. If you have a mod you think would fit well into the theme of the list - let me know.
8. Don't get upset if #7 doesn't make it into the modlist - too many reasons to list why it might not fit in
9. This list is evergreen - this is a living document that will be updated as needed.
