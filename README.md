# FINAL FANTASY TES V
A Skyrim Wabbajack modlist

If you are seeing this, then you are part of the testing group.
Proceeding in using this modlist means you understand and agree to the following:

0. Creating a Wabbajack modlist is a huge time sink and a very painful grind to learn/complete.
1. The modlist is incomplete and transitory (Not all mods have been added, and not all mods will make the final cut!).
2. The mods have been configured for intended play/interactions but are not final - Settings will be adjusted according to feedback.
3. If you feel a part of the game is overtuned/undertuned please use the Simply Balanced mod in the MCM to adjust the game to your playstyle.
4. Do not add mods or remove mods from this list - I will find out & you will be banned from further test groups (you'll have to wait for public betas/releases like everyone else).
5. Take the time to report texture, mesh, blackface bugs - this testing phase is to help develop the modlist into a more stable/playable state - NOT an early access.
6. Don't expect this initial hodge podge of mods to be in any state for a stable and/or long play through.
7. If you have a mod you think would fit well into the theme of the list - let me know.
8. Don't get upset if #7 doesn't make it into the modlist - too many reasons to list why it might not fit in
9. This list is evergreen - this is a living document that will be updated as needed.
10. You must own the Anniversary Addition of Skyrim, and have the Skyrim Creation Kit installed.
